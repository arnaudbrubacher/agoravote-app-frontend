# AgoraVote Application Rules for AI

## Project Overview
- AgoraVote is an online voting app and governance platform
- It allows organizations to share information and vote securely
- The application consists of frontend (Vue.js/Nuxt.js) and backend (Go/Gin) components

## Project Structure
- Frontend: Vue.js/Nuxt.js application (current repository)
- Backend: Go application with Gin framework (located at ../agoravote-app-backend)

## IMPORTANT: ALWAYS MAINTAIN FULL-STACK AWARENESS
- The AI MUST maintain awareness of both frontend and backend components
- The AI MUST consider backend implementation when suggesting frontend changes
- The AI MUST reference backend code when explaining how features work
- The AI MUST NOT forget the existence or structure of the backend repository

## Backend Architecture
- Go-based API using Gin framework
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT authentication
- RESTful API endpoints at http://localhost:8080
- Domain-driven design with separate packages for users, groups, posts, votes

## ElectionGuard Security Integration
- The backend integrates with ElectionGuard SDK for secure, end-to-end verifiable voting
- ElectionGuard uses homomorphic encryption to secure ballots
- Integration uses CGo to interface between Go and C++ ElectionGuard library
- API endpoint: POST /electionguard/encrypt-ballot

## Key Models
- User: Authentication and profile information
- Group: Organizations for collaboration
- Post: Content shared within groups
- Vote: Secure voting functionality

## Security Considerations
- All voting operations must use the ElectionGuard encryption
- Frontend must handle encrypted ballot data correctly
- Authentication and authorization are critical for all voting operations
- Encrypted ballots must be verifiable by voters
- The system must maintain voter privacy while ensuring vote integrity

## Project Purpose
- AgoraVote is an online voting app and governance platform
- It is modeled as a social network
- It allows organizations to govern: share information and vote
- The voting functionality is a core feature requiring special security attention
