# Agoravote App Frontend

Agoravote is a frontend application built with Vue.js that serves as a platform for managing groups, posts, votes, and user authentication. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Important: Full-Stack Application

This is part of a full-stack application:
- **Frontend**: This repository (Vue.js/Nuxt.js)
- **Backend**: Located at [../agoravote-app-backend](../agoravote-app-backend) (Go/Gin)

The backend provides critical functionality including:
- API endpoints for all data operations
- Database interactions
- Authentication and authorization
- ElectionGuard integration for secure voting

Always consider both repositories when making changes.

## Features

- **Group Management**: Create and manage groups.
- **Post Management**: Create and retrieve posts within groups.
- **Voting System**: Cast and retrieve votes on posts.
- **User Authentication**: Login and manage user sessions.
